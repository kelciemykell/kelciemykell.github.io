                    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
                    <img src="images/apple.png" alt= "apple.com home page">
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a> uses white space really well. They use minimal text and the product pictures
                        they use are only thier products with little to nothing else in them. Each picture is surrounded 
                        by ample white space, which draws the viewers eye to the picture. They also use mainly white 
                        with black accents which also helps to give the page a clean appearance.

                    <h2>Repetition</h2>
                    <img src="images/disney.png/" alt="disney.com home page">
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://www.disney.com">Disney.com</a> is a good example of repetition. Throughout their site they repeatedly group similar things 
                        together in this 4-box layout. This makes it easier to see what things belong together and it 
                        also makes the site easier to navigate.

                    <h2>Contrast</h2>
                    <img src="Images/starwars.png"
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://www.starwars.com">starwars.com</a> uses contrast really well. The background of their site is black, and the text is white,
                        or another light, bright color (such as yellow) which makes it stand out quite a bit. They also 
                        use images with  white backgrounds so that they stand out form the background of the site rather 
                        than blending in.
